> What is a factorial?
 
Well it is the multiplication of a series of numbers. 

```
For instance 4! = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1
7! = 7x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1
```

Factorials are used commonly in many fields including when computers translate text. Here is a video of how we can:
- write code to help us calculate a factorial
- write a function that we can reuse every time we need to calculate a factorial
